# WebSocket Integration Flow

## Updated Architecture with WebSocket Notifications

### **Inbound Message Flow (WITH WebSocket Notifications)**

```
WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram/Telegram
           ↓ (webhook)
    Webhook Service
           ↓ (queue message)
    Inbound Processor
           ↓ (WebSocket notification)
    WebSocket Service → Connected Users
```

**Why WebSocket notifications for inbound?**
- ✅ Users need to know about NEW messages from customers
- ✅ Real-time updates for conversation list
- ✅ Multi-device synchronization
- ✅ Agent notifications

### **Outbound Message Flow (NO WebSocket Notifications)**

```
Frontend/UI
    ↓ (HTTP POST)
Outbound Processor
    ↓ (HTTP response)
Frontend/UI (updates immediately)
```

**Why NO WebSocket notifications for outbound?**
- ✅ User already knows they sent the message
- ✅ HTTP response is sufficient
- ✅ Simpler architecture
- ✅ Fewer failure points

## **Complete Message Flow**

### 1. **Inbound Message (Customer → Agent)**
```
Customer sends message on WhatsApp
    ↓
Webhook receives → stores in DB → queues for processing
    ↓
Inbound Processor processes → sends WebSocket notification
    ↓
Connected agents see new message in real-time
```

### 2. **Outbound Message (Agent → Customer)**
```
Agent sends message via UI
    ↓
Outbound Processor sends to platform → stores in DB
    ↓
HTTP response confirms success
    ↓
UI updates immediately (no WebSocket needed)
```

## **WebSocket Notification Types**

### **Inbound Messages:**
- `new_message` - New message received from customer
- `conversation_assigned` - Conversation assigned to agent
- `typing_indicator` - Customer is typing

### **Outbound Messages:**
- ❌ No WebSocket notifications needed
- ✅ HTTP response handles success/failure
- ✅ Frontend updates UI immediately

## **Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Simpler Architecture**
   - WebSocket only for inbound notifications
   - HTTP for outbound operations

2. **Better User Experience**
   - Real-time notifications for new messages
   - Immediate feedback for sent messages

3. **Reduced Complexity**
   - Fewer moving parts
   - Less error handling
   - Clearer separation of concerns

4. **Performance**
   - No unnecessary WebSocket traffic for outbound
   - Faster outbound message sending
